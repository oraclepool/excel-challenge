Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
We need more information on the “successful” state. Just because a campaign reached its goal and delivered the products and services can we take it a step further and find out how many are successful in the long run. More importantly how many of the “successful” campaigns became profitable and established companies.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
There dataset is not large enough for all categories and subcategories, so some of the results are not statistically relevant given the small sample size. We need to figure out how statistically significant these results are.



What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
If we could analyze the data by states, we could see trends in which states have Kickstarters with the highest rates of success and which ones have the lowest rate of success.
